# Summary
In this repository, I have stored a training module titled **"AI Learning Module: Hyperparameter Tuning and Interpretable AI"** (`Mital_AGU_2021_AI_module_github.ipynb`) I presented this module at the "Critical Zone Network of Networks Workshop" at American Geophysical Union Fall Meeting, New Orleans, LA, Dec 9, 2021.

I developed the module in python, using google colab.

## Data sources

Elevation Data in the PRISM_us_dem_4km_bil directory obtained from the PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, https://prism.oregonstate.edu, data created 10 Dec 2014, accessed 30 Nov 2021.

The PRISM elevation data was cropped to obtain UCWRR_DEM_800m.tif.

Data and metadata in NRCS_dates_2008_2017.csv and Metadata_processed.csv, respectively, were orignally sourced from the NRCS online portal (https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/wcc/home/).
